### Description of Problem:
* This project aims to achieve a module that could check grammar of the sentences that are given.
Give the directory of the file, all the suspicious of the sentences in the file and the suspicious of the phrases in  the sentences will be checked.
Suspicious close to 100 means most suspicious, close to 0 means we believe it is correct.
* To make the checker with high accuracy, we implemented two main checking methods.
Check some common grammar error, and check whether the phrases of the sentences exists in our huge correct phrases stored. 
To guarantee the speed and correctness of the checker, we let our crawler to crawl many different kind of website.
Then we processed the data, divide the sentences into phrases and removed the duplicated phrases.
* Current problem we are facing: Although we have stored huge correct phrases, but when the sentence contains a lot specific names and locations the result might be incorrect.
We have wrote some code to avoid it, but due to time limitation there is still some more work to do.We will try to fix it soon.
### Description of the Implementation 
* Checker -- Main Feature:  
Check the grammar of all the sentences in the text file that the user want.  
Show suspicious of all the sentences in the file, and the suspicious of phrases in the sentence.  
In a frontend Graphic User Interface, the checker taking the path of a text file as the input and listing suspicious phrases.

Data Structure and Construction Mechanism:

To guarantee the speed and correctness of the checker,the checker analysis the sentences in two main methods. 

1. The first method is analyzing the sentences using the sentences we get from our crawler.We break the sentences into two or three word phrases, and check whether
   phrases for the sentence to be checked exists in our file generated by the crawler. We have used the crawler
   to crawl multiple different kind of website, so it covers most common phrases.
   We have also processed the data from the crawler by removing the duplication or wrong format.
2. Another method to test the sentence is by checking some basic rules that all the correct sentence should follow. For example,
   the location of the verb and noun, or type more than one spaces between two words and etc.
   We averaged the the suspicious of the phrases in the sentence, to avoid some correct phrases that we haven't covered.
   Then add the suspicious caused by violating basic grammar rules to the averaged phrases suspicious to get the final result.
   Suspicions equal to 100 means the sentence is most suspicious. When equal to 0, we believe it is completely correct.
   The data structure we used include HashMap, Set and etc.We use the HashMap to store all the phrases in the sentences and the suspicious,
   so we can easily change the suspicious of the phrases.We use Set to proceed the data generated by the crawler to guarantee there is no duplicated phrase.
* GUI  
We built a java GUI for the checker.At the landing page, you shall type or paste the directory to the file that you want to test.
Then press `confirm` and `show result`, the result will be shown both at the text area in the GUI and the standard output. 

### Features that the module already been implemented:

* Crawler -- Main Feature: 
Crawler's main objective is indexing web content with formal, diversified linguistic content in order to serve the checker.

Currently, txt file is the media that connect the crawler and checker that storing correct phrases. It's not realistic to 
achieve both formality and diversity at the same time by using simple text file. Content in government agency officials and 
academic website is formal but comparatively weaker in vocabulary， whereas social media is in reverse. Therefore， this 
language correction have two versions of checker that works separately to serve the checker.


Version1: Social Media Crawler:
This crawler is derived from the twitter4j package.
Crawling and regularizing messages based on twitter,  learning language grammatical construction and storing phrases.</br>


Version2: URL-based Crawler:
For this crawler, user can choose their optional website. 

To do this option, user should copy the URL link and paste into the 
variable `StartLink` and Specified the path and text filename in the `SaveLocation` variable series in the crawler module.
Demonstration of this code is based on the official website of Boston Government这名字最好更具体些: https://www.boston.gov/departments/parking-clerk/how-get-resident-parking-permit
是只有这一个link吗？
1. As the link is initialized, it first goes to an HTML parser that checks the validity of the link’s format. The parser contains a HashSet that stores the link. `Downloadpage`, `readtxt`, `htmlextract`, are followed to process a “raw paragraph” from the website. Detailed descriptions toward these function shall go to see the comments from 		`crawler.java`
2. The `cutsentence` function tries to separate the sentence from the paragraph by identifying the capital letter, which should be optimized in the next term.
3. Sentences being transferred to `output.txt`. The `filter`, in the end, grabs the output file and forms the `clause` text file that used for the checker unit
Filter’s mechanism在这里还需要在解释细节一些,主要是为什么长度设为20
另外那个检索30条的地方还有点小混乱。。。

## Code
* The Checker is in the main branch and the crawler is in the crawler branch.
* For the checker, we have provided the two test files,they were in the TestFiles directory called largerTest.txt and simpleTest.txt
(we recommend you to use these two files to check our checker first, then use your own file you want)
* The installation guide is at part three of our INSTALL.txt
